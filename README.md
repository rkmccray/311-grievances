# 311-grievances methodology

To figure out what proportion of grievances are initiated by using 311, I gathered data available from the NYC Department of Corrections Office of Constituent and Grievance Services (OCGS). OCGS is required to file quarterly reports documenting how many grievances they receive by category, facility, submission method, and resolution stage. I pulled the data from these reports, disaggregating the grievances by submission method to see how many more 311 complaints were made compared to other submission methods. The accompanying data visualization illustrates how dramatically the number of 311 submissions outpaces other categories. I also disaggregated and illustrated the data over time by submission type, pulling out the "grievable" complaints category and charting how those numbers changed over time.

Caveats and Shortcomings

Quarterly grievance reports from OCGS are currently only available on the department’s website beginning in the second quarter of 2020. I filed a FOIL request for the reports prior to that quarter and am still awaiting a response. This means the data in this story does not chart the evolution of 311 calls over the 10 years since 311 calls were made free for people in city jails. 

OCGS tracks complaints that they consider "grievable" and "non-grievable." Many complaints that are considered "non-grievable" are managed through processes outside of the main grievance system. For this story, I only examined "grievable" complaints. Non-grievable categories of complaints include serious issues, such as sexual assault allegations, use of force by corrections staff, bail-related issues, requests for disability-related accommodations, and requests for protective custody. It's important to keep in mind that the data I've illustrated here does not encompass the totality of issues faced by people incarcerated in New York City jails. 

The "tablet" category was not present in the OCGS data until the 4th quarter of 2022, because tablets weren't as widely distributed across the jail system before then. The lack of grievances prior to that quarter doesn't reflect a lack of tablet complaints, but rather a lack of tablets.

The "other" cateogry of grievance submission type has grown steadily and reflects a substantial number of complaints, but I was unable to get an answer from the Department of Correction on what exactly is included in this category.

The city’s Open Data portal provides a wealth of information about 311 calls from New York City residents complaining about issues impacting numerous city agencies. But the Department of Corrections’ 311 data isn’t included, creating another barrier for any New Yorker trying to better understand what’s happening with all these calls from jails. When asked about the absence of this information from an otherwise robust dataset, a 311 customer relations representative affirmed that jail system complaints are routed to the Department of Correction "through different systems."
