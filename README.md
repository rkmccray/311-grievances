# 311-grievances methodology

To figure out what proportion of grievances are initiated by using 311, I gathered data available from the NYC Department of Corrections Office of Constituent and Grievance Services (OCGS). OCGS is required to file quarterly reports documenting how many grievances they receive by category, facility, submission method, and resolution stage. I pulled the data from these reports, disaggregating the grievances by submission method to see how many more 311 complaints were made compared to other submission methods. The accompanying data visualization illustrates how dramatically the number of 311 submissions outpaces other categories. I also disaggregated and illustrated the data over time by submission type.

Caveats and Shortcomings

Quarterly grievance reports from OCGS are currently only available on the departmentâ€™s website beginning in the second quarter of 2020. I filed a FOIL request for the reports prior to that quarter and am still awaiting a response. This means the data in this story does not chart the evolution of 311 calls over the 10 years since 311 calls were made free for people in city jails. 

The "tablet" category was not present in the OCGS data until the 4th quarter of 2022, because tablets weren't as widely distributed across the jail system before then. The lack of grievances prior to that quarter doesn't reflect a lack of tablet complaints, but rather a lack of tablets.

The "other" cateogry of grievance submission type has grown steadily, but I was unable to get an answer from the Department of Correction on what is encompassed in this category.
