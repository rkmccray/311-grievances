# 311-grievances 

To figure out what proportion of grievances are initiated by using 311, I gathered data available from the NYC Department of Corrections Office of Constituent and Grievance Services (OCGS). OCGS is required to file quarterly reports documenting how many grievances they receive by category, facility, submission method, and resolution stage. I pulled the data from these reports, disaggregating the grievances by submission type to see how many more 311 complaints were made compared to other submission methods. Then I created a data visualization to illustrate how dramatically the number of 311 submissions outpaces other categories. 

Shortcomings

Quarterly grievance reports from OCGS are currently only available on the departmentâ€™s website beginning in the second quarter of 2020. I filed a FOIL request for the reports prior to that quarter and am still awaiting a response.
