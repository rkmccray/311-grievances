<h1> “Into the Void”: 311 Calls From City Jails are Still Going Unheard </h1>

		<h2> 311 is the most popular way to lodge a complaint, but advocates say no one is listening. </h2>

	</div>

		<div class="p1">
			<p>Last year, a man incarcerated at Rikers asked Indigo Griffith for help following up on a complaint he had made through the jail’s grievance system by calling 311. A package sent by a family member never made it past the mailroom, he said, and though he had attempted to initiate the formal grievance process, he hadn’t heard back. Griffith, a prisoner’s rights legal advocate with the Bronx Defenders, reached out to the Department of Corrections office responsible for tracking and resolving grievances. </p>
		</div>

		<div class="p2">
			<p>When a person in city custody makes a complaint, their grievance is assigned a number that is supposed to make it possible for them to check on the progress of their response. But when Griffith asked about the status of their client’s complaint, the department told them to file a Freedom of Information Law request. When the response finally arrived 30 days later, instead of documentation of the complaint working its way through the system, Griffith received copies of their own email exchange with the department asking about the complaint.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="p3">
			<p>“There was no other documentation of the grievance,” said Griffith. “There was no investigation or attempt to resolve the issue at all.”</p>
		</div>

		<div class="p4">
			<p>Though this particular Kafka-esque encounter with the city’s jail system stands out to Griffith, the failure to effectively process and resolve a complaint lodged by someone in custody is all too familiar. And while 311 is the most commonly used method of kickstarting the beleaguered complaint process, according to data from the Office of Constituent and Grievance Services (OCGS), advocates say many incarcerated people are going unheard.</p>

</script>
	</div>

	<div class="p5">
		<p>“A lot of those 311 complaints will just go into the void, unless it's something really egregious,” said Griffith. “I haven't really heard of any clients who have been able to successfully get a complaint number and then follow up and actually see any tangible results.”</p>

	</div>

	<div class="p6">
		<p>The deficiencies of the Department of Corrections’ grievance system have been a point of contention between advocates, incarcerated people, and DOC staff for many years. Prior to 2015, the only way for a person detained in a New York City jail to formally lodge a complaint was by filling out a physical grievance form and placing it in a grievance box, or handing it to a correction officer. This procedure came with its own shortcomings: grievance boxes weren’t available in all housing units, and handing a complaint to an officer inhibited the privacy of the person filing the complaint, and created an opportunity for retaliation. </p>
	</div>

	<div class="p7">

		<p>In 2015, the city made calls to 311 free of charge for people in city jails. But calling 311 doesn’t officially trigger the grievance process: these complaints are forwarded to OCGS, and a DOC staff member must follow up in person with the complainant and assist them in filing a formal grievance. That's where things often fall apart, according to Michael Klinger, a jail services attorney with the Brooklyn Defenders.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="p8">
		<p>“Grievance officers do tour periodically, but do they announce themselves adequately? Not always," said Klinger. "Sometimes they come at a funny hour, when people are still asleep, and think they satisfy their requirement to tour by doing that. Or maybe they don't come around at all.”</p>

	</div>

	<div class="p9">
		<p>These systemic hiccups can leave incarcerated people without any opportunity for recourse when facing many different problems. Grievances span a wide range of issues, including law library access, food, mental health, recreation time, and personal hygiene-related complaints. Between the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 and the third quarter of 2024, the span of time in which grievance data is currently publicly available, medical complaints outpaced all other categories.</p>

</script>

	</div>
	<div class="p10">
		<p>Klinger, who has testified before the city’s Board of Correction about the challenges his clients face when navigating the grievance system, says he has seen modest improvement in the last year or two. Like Griffith, he has filed a public records request to try to see what progress has been made on his clients’ complaints.  
		</p>
	<div class="p11">
		<p>“Sometimes, we can see a lot of emails that are generated internally, back and forth between departments, seemingly working on the grievance,” said Klinger. “There's definitely a lot of people at work there. It's just that where the rubber meets the road, our clients are still not very often getting whatever it was they were asking for.”</p>

	<div class="p12">
		<p>The Department of Corrections declined a request for comment. The Board of Correction, an independent agency that monitors the city’s jails and has published multiple reports documenting the grievance system’s shortcomings, did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p>

	<div class="p13">
		<p>Barbara Hamilton, who has represented clients in the city’s jail system for 15 years as a Legal Aid attorney, sees understaffing as a central issue.</p>
	<div class="p14">
		<p>“You're talking about an agency with essentially a broken system that's not staffed, and that oftentimes doesn't have the resources to fulfill its obligation under its own rules,” said Hamilton. In spite of free 311 calls offering a welcome alternative to other grievance submission methods, she hasn’t observed any fine-tuning of the system.</p>

	<div class="p15">
		<p>“From my end, the status quo continues,” she added. “It’s not looking better, 10 years later.”</p>
